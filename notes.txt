1. to create a new file - npm create vite@latest
2. cd into the project name and then do npm i for all the 
    node modules
3. use npm run dev for vite and start for create-react (because in the scripts in node modules, it says vite
    under dev)
4. only keep index.js and app.js in src and remove all comments from index.js


learning vite

1. in the app, you can return functions from other programs too by doing
    return(<file/>).
2. you can only return one tag though so if u want to return multiple things make a
    <> and </> and then have multiple tags inside it.
3. syntax for creating an element - const reactElement = React.createElement(
    'a',
    {
        href: 'https://google.com',
        target: '_blank'
    },
    'click me to visit google'
    any variable that u wanna use (it'll just get added after in the text of the url)
)
4. to create a new file -> npm create vite@latest
5. to run -> npm run dev
